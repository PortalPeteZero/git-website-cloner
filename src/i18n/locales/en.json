        "answer": "If we confirm you have a water leak but cannot locate it, there's no charge for our leak detection service - this has never happened yet. However, if we find that you don't have a leak and your problem is caused by something else, we charge 50% of the inspection cost for a 'Leak Confirmation Survey' and provide a report for your peace of mind."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is your water leak detection in Lanzarote?",
        "answer": "We use a multi-technology approach with over €80,000 in specialist leak detection equipment to confirm every leak location using at least two independent technologies. This provides centimetre precision in 95% of cases, locating water leaks to within 30cm² of their position - keeping repair costs and disruption to an absolute minimum."
      },
      {
        "question": "What areas of Lanzarote do you cover for leak detection?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer leak repair as well as detection?",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer complete leak repair services in Lanzarote for water pipe leak repair, pool leak repair and underground leak repair. However, you're also free to use your own contractor for the repair - you're not obliged to use our repair team. We provide detailed reports to guide any repair work."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will you need to break walls or floors to find my water leak?",
        "answer": "Our hidden water leak detection methods are non-invasive. We use acoustic sensors, thermal imaging, tracer gas, CCTV cameras and other advanced technology to locate leaks without damaging your property. In rare cases, minimal access may be needed, but this is discussed and agreed beforehand."
      },
      {
        "question": "What leak detection technology do you use?",
        "answer": "We carry the latest leak detection equipment including: GASENSE tracer gas detection, acoustic geophones for underground water leak detection, infrared thermal imaging cameras for hidden water leak detection, pipe microphones with centimetre precision, and multiple CCTV camera systems for pipes of all sizes."

      },
      {
        "question": "My water meter is running - do I have a leak?",
        "answer": "A constantly running water meter often indicates a hidden water leak. Our FREE leak confirmation test can determine whether you have a leak before committing to a full inspection. We'll assess your water system, check the basics and provide a professional report at no cost."

        "question": "Why is my pool losing water?",
        "answer": "If your swimming pool is losing more than 6mm of water per day (beyond normal evaporation), you likely have a leak. Common causes include cracks in the pool shell, damaged pipe connections or faulty fittings. Our pool leak detection service in Lanzarote can pinpoint the exact location using pressure testing and specialist equipment."
      },
      {
        "question": "My water meter is running when all taps are off - do I have a leak?",
        "answer": "Yes, if your water meter continues running when no water is being used, this indicates a hidden water leak somewhere on your property. This could be in underground pipes, under floor slabs or behind walls. Our acoustic and thermal imaging leak detection can find these hidden leaks without breaking walls or floors."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you find water leaks underground?",
        "answer": "We use multiple technologies to find underground water leaks: tracer gas detection (GASENSE), acoustic listening devices (geophones) and thermal imaging. By combining at least two methods, we achieve centimetre precision in locating underground leaks, minimising excavation and repair costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you detect leaks in pool pipes?",
        "answer": "Yes, we specialise in pool pipe leak detection. We use pressure testing to isolate leaks in pool plumbing, then pinpoint the exact location using acoustic equipment and tracer gas. This works for underground pool pipes, return lines and suction lines."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you repair leaks or just detect them?",
        "answer": "We offer both leak detection and leak repair services across Lanzarote. Once we locate your leak, we can repair it ourselves or provide detailed guidance for your chosen contractor. Our reports include the exact location and recommended repair methods."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does leak detection cost in Lanzarote?",
        "answer": "We offer fixed-fee leak detection inspections with no hidden costs. Prices vary based on property size and complexity. Contact us for a free quote. Remember our No Find, No Fee guarantee - if we confirm you have a leak but can't locate it, there's no charge."

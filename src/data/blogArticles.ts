## Introduction

For residents of Lanzarote, managing water is a fundamental aspect of daily life, deeply woven into the island's history and infrastructure. Unlike the straightforward mains-fed systems common in many parts of the world, Lanzarote's homes often rely on a unique combination of an underground water tank, known as an **aljibe**, and a pump system. This setup is a direct response to the island's arid climate and historical water scarcity.

However, this traditional system presents modern challenges, particularly when it comes to detecting water leaks. At Canary Detect, we find that many puzzling leak scenarios are rooted in a misunderstanding of how these systems operate. This article explains the history behind Lanzarote's water network, how it functions, and why it makes leak detection a unique challenge.

![Traditional Lanzarote Architecture](/assets/blog/lanzarote-traditional-house.jpg)

*The iconic white, flat-roofed architecture of Lanzarote, set against the volcanic landscape. Modern domestic aljibes are typically filled by tanker rather than rainwater.*

## A History Forged by Scarcity

![Canarian Cistern](/assets/blog/lanzarote-aljibe-cistern.jpg)

*A traditional Canarian cistern (aljibe) in Lanzarote, showing the underground tank access point surrounded by volcanic soil.*

Lanzarote is the driest of the Canary Islands, receiving minimal rainfall and possessing no natural rivers or significant surface water. The term **aljibe** itself comes from the Arabic *al-gúbb*, meaning cistern or well, a technology introduced to the Iberian Peninsula centuries ago to store precious water in arid regions.

Historically, the islanders were masters of water conservation, developing methods to capture every possible drop. This included large-scale public reservoirs (*maretas*) and channels to collect rainwater runoff. While the classic, flat-roofed design of Canarian houses was perfect for channeling rainwater into a household aljibe, the primary method for filling these domestic tanks for many years has been through water tanker delivery, known locally as a *pipa*.

Even with the advent of modern desalination plants in the 1960s, which now supply the entire island, the legacy of water scarcity persists. The mains water supply can be inconsistent, with low pressure and, in some rural areas, scheduled cuts that can leave homes without water for days at a time. As a result, the aljibe and pump system remains an essential component of most households, providing a crucial buffer and ensuring consistent water pressure.

![Water Tanker](/assets/blog/lanzarote-water-tanker.jpg)

*Water tankers (pipas) are still a common sight in the Canary Islands, delivering water to fill domestic aljibes, especially during supply interruptions.*

## How the Aljibe and Pump System Works

A typical domestic water system in Lanzarote consists of three main parts:

1. **The Aljibe:** An underground storage tank, typically made of concrete, that holds the home's primary water reserve. It is filled from the mains supply via a pipe controlled by a float valve.
2. **The Float Valve (Ballcock):** This valve automatically opens to top up the aljibe from the mains when the water level drops and closes when it is full. It functions just like the mechanism inside a toilet cistern.
3. **The Pressure Pump (Grupo de Presión):** Because the mains pressure is often too low for household needs, a pump is used to draw water from the aljibe and deliver it to the taps, showers, and appliances at a consistent, usable pressure.

Many homes also feature a **mains bypass**. This is a branch off the mains supply (after the ballcock feed to the aljibe) that connects directly to the house pipework after the pump, controlled by a valve. In practice, this bypass is often left open, with the pump running as normal. The mains provides a base level of pressure, and the pump "tops up" the pressure to ensure adequate flow throughout the house. If the pump fails, the house still receives water directly from the mains (albeit at lower pressure). This dual-feed arrangement is practical but adds complexity when diagnosing leaks.

![House Context Diagram](/assets/blog/lanzarote-water-system-house.png)

*A typical Lanzarote domestic water system in context: mains water enters via the meter, feeds the underground aljibe through a float valve, and the pressure pump (above ground) draws water up to supply the house. The bypass valve allows mains water to supplement the pump supply.*

![Schematic Diagram](/assets/blog/lanzarote-water-system-diagram.png)

*Schematic view: mains water feeds the aljibe via a float valve, while a bypass branch (often left open) provides direct mains pressure. The pump draws from the aljibe to boost pressure, and both supplies combine before reaching the house.*

## The Unique Challenge of Leak Detection

This system creates specific challenges when trying to identify a water leak, often leading to confusing signals from the water meter.

### Mystery 1: The Intermittent Water Meter

A common assumption is that a leak will cause the water meter to spin continuously. With an aljibe system, this is rarely the case. If you have a leak inside your house (e.g., a dripping tap or a faulty toilet), the water is being lost from the **pump-fed side** of the system. The water is coming from the aljibe, not directly from the mains.

Your water meter will only spin for brief periods when the float valve in the aljibe opens to replenish the water that has been lost. This means a significant leak can go unnoticed, as the meter appears to be static most of the time, only to spin intermittently as the tank tops itself up.

### Mystery 2: The Constantly Spinning Meter (That Isn't a Leak)

Conversely, a constantly spinning meter doesn't always mean you have a leak in your property's pipework. The most common culprit in this scenario is a **faulty float valve** in the aljibe itself.

If the valve fails to close properly when the tank is full, water from the mains will continuously trickle in and overflow from the aljibe. However, you are unlikely to see water pooling on the surface. Most aljibes are not fully watertight all the way up. The upper section, typically above the 80-90% full level or above where the ballcock sits, is often not sealed. When water rises past this point, it simply seeps into the surrounding ground and disappears under your patio tiles, completely unnoticed. To an observer, the meter spins non-stop, creating the perfect illusion of a major leak. In reality, it is a simple mechanical failure in the tank's filling mechanism.

![Water Meter Leak Detection](/assets/blog/lanzarote-water-meter-leak.png)

*A spinning leak indicator on a water meter can be caused by a true leak or a faulty float valve in the aljibe.*

### The Telltale Pump

One of the clearest signs of a leak in an aljibe system is the behaviour of the pump itself. If no one is using water, the pump should stay silent. A leak on the pump-fed side will slowly drain the pressure in the system, causing the pump to kick in periodically to restore it.

### The Non-Return Valve Factor

A critical but often overlooked component in these systems is the **non-return valve** (also called a check valve). These are typically installed at the water meter and on the mains bypass pipework. Their job is to prevent water from flowing backward into the mains supply.

When a non-return valve fails, the higher pressure from the pump can push water back toward the mains. This causes the pump to run frequently as it tries to maintain pressure against a system that is effectively "leaking" water back the way it came. The symptoms mimic a genuine leak: the pump cycles on and off, and the water meter spins.

You might assume that water flowing backward would cause the meter to spin in reverse, reducing your bill. In practice, the opposite is usually true. Water meters are designed to measure forward flow, and when water oscillates back and forth due to pressure fluctuations, the meter tends to register more forward movement than backward. The result is a higher water bill, not a lower one.

### The Bypass Complication

If your property has a mains bypass, it adds another layer of complexity. A leak could exist on the mains-fed side or the pump-fed side, and isolating the source requires systematically shutting off different parts of the system to observe the meter's behaviour. This can be a challenging process for the average homeowner.

## Conclusion: Know Your System

Understanding whether your water comes directly from the mains or via an aljibe and pump is the first and most critical step in diagnosing a potential leak in Lanzarote. The behaviour of your water meter can be misleading if you don't know what it's connected to.

If you suspect a leak but can't make sense of what your water meter is telling you, the unique characteristics of your water system are likely the reason. Before you face a high water bill or potential property damage, it's essential to get an expert diagnosis.

## Can You Drink the Water?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions by visitors and new residents, and the answer is not a simple "yes" or "no." It requires understanding the difference between the water entering your property and the water coming out of your tap.

### The Official Stance: Yes, It's Potable

Legally and technically, the water supplied by Canal Gestión Lanzarote is safe to drink. It is desalinated seawater that undergoes reverse osmosis, remineralisation (adding calcium and magnesium), and chlorination. It must meet strict sanitary criteria set by **EU Directive 2020/2184** on the quality of water intended for human consumption.

Regular testing is conducted to ensure it meets these standards at the point of supply. Experts from the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and local health inspectors have confirmed that the mains water is safe, often containing less plastic residue than bottled water.

### The Reality: It Depends on Your Tank

While the water is safe when it passes through the meter, the safety of what comes out of your tap depends entirely on where it has been stored.

In our years at Canary Detect, we have inspected the inside of countless aljibes. The reality is stark:

- **The Good:** Some tanks are pristine, well-maintained, and perfectly safe.
- **The Bad:** Others are sites of "pure horror" that would make you run to the toilet just looking at them. We have seen tanks with sediment buildup, root intrusion, crumbling concrete, and even drowned pests.

If your tap water comes from an aljibe that hasn't been cleaned or inspected in years, it may no longer be safe to drink, regardless of its quality at the meter.

### Our Recommendation

If you want to drink tap water (which is cheaper, eco-friendly, and convenient), follow these rules:

1. **Bypass the Tank for Drinking:** The safest option is to have a dedicated "drinking water tap" in your kitchen that is plumbed **directly to the mains**, bypassing the aljibe and pump entirely. This ensures you are drinking the regulated, safe water directly from the supply network.
2. **Maintain Your Aljibe:** If you must use tank water, treat your aljibe like the critical infrastructure it is. It requires regular inspection, cleaning, and waterproofing to prevent contamination.
3. **Check the Condition:** Don't assume your tank is clean. Have it inspected. If it's in poor condition, use it only for washing and flushing until it can be professionally remediated.

## Is Your Swimming Pool Losing Water?

If you've noticed your pool water level dropping faster than usual, you're not alone. Many pool owners in Lanzarote face this problem, especially during the hot summer months. But how do you know if it's evaporation or an actual leak?

In this comprehensive guide, we'll show you **how to check for pool leaks** using simple DIY methods, and explain when it's time to call professional leak detection services.

## Understanding Pool Water Loss

Before panicking about a potential leak, it's important to understand that some water loss is normal:

- **Evaporation**: In Lanzarote's warm climate, pools can lose 3-7mm of water per day through evaporation
- **Splash-out**: Active swimming and play can cause significant water loss
- **Backwash**: Filter cleaning removes water from your pool
- **Wind**: Lanzarote's trade winds accelerate evaporation

If you're losing more than 5cm of water per week, you likely have a leak that needs attention.

## The Bucket Test: Your First Step

The bucket test is the most reliable DIY method to determine if your pool is leaking or just evaporating water. Watch this excellent video from Swim University that demonstrates exactly how to perform the test:

<div class="video-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqiz4qBJU_g&t=37s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="video-link group"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Zqiz4qBJU_g/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Pool Bucket Test Video - How to Find a Pool Leak" class="video-thumb-img" /><span class="play-button">▶</span><span class="video-caption">🎬 Watch: Pool Bucket Test - How to Find a Pool Leak (YouTube)</span></a></div>

### Step-by-Step Bucket Test

1. **Bring your pool water to normal level** before starting the test
2. **Fill a 5-gallon bucket** with pool water to about one inch from the top
3. **Place the bucket on the first or second step** so the water temperature matches
4. **Mark the water level** inside the bucket with tape or marker
5. **Mark the pool water level** on the outside of the bucket
6. **Wait 24 hours** without using the pool or running any equipment
7. **Compare the levels** - if the pool level dropped more than the bucket level, you have a leak

### Interpreting Your Results

- **Equal drop**: Normal evaporation - no leak detected
- **Pool dropped more**: You have a leak - time for professional leak detection
- **Pool dropped significantly more**: Serious leak requiring immediate attention

## The Dye Test: Locating Visible Leaks

If you suspect a leak near fittings, lights, or visible cracks, the dye test can help confirm:

1. Turn off all pool equipment
2. Let the water become completely still
3. Use food colouring or leak detection dye
4. Squirt dye near suspected areas
5. Watch if the dye is pulled into any cracks or gaps

**Pro tip**: This test works best on calm days with no wind.

## Common Swimming Pool Leak Locations

## Hidden Water Leaks: The Silent Property Destroyer

Underground water leaks are among the most damaging problems a homeowner can face. Unlike visible leaks, they can go undetected for months or even years, slowly causing structural damage and wasting thousands of euros in water.

In Lanzarote, where water is precious and expensive, detecting underground leaks early is crucial. Here are the **7 warning signs** every homeowner should know.

## 1. Unexplained High Water Bills

The most common first sign of an underground leak is a sudden increase in your water bill without a corresponding increase in usage.

**What to look for:**
- Bill 20% or more higher than usual
- Steady increase over several months
- No change in household water habits

**Pro tip**: Compare your current bill to the same period last year, as seasonal variations can affect usage.

## 2. Water Meter Running When All Taps Are Off

This is one of the most definitive tests for a hidden water leak:

### How to Check Your Water Meter

1. Turn off all water-using appliances
2. Make sure no taps are running
3. Locate your water meter
4. Note the reading or watch the dial
5. Wait 30 minutes without using any water
6. Check the meter again

If the meter has moved, you have a leak somewhere in your system.

## 3. Wet or Soggy Patches in Your Garden

Underground water leaks often surface as unexplained wet areas:

- **Unusually green patches** in otherwise dry lawn
- **Muddy or soft spots** that never dry out
- **Water pooling** on the surface with no obvious source
- **Erosion channels** appearing in landscaping

In Lanzarote's dry climate, persistent wet spots are particularly suspicious.

## 4. Low Water Pressure Throughout the House

A leak in your main supply line can cause noticeable pressure drops:

- **Gradual decrease** in pressure over weeks or months
- **Affects all taps** equally (unlike a fixture-specific problem)
- **Worse during** peak usage times

## 5. Cracks in Walls, Floors, or Foundation

Water undermines foundations and causes structural movement:

- **New cracks** appearing in walls or ceilings
- **Doors and windows** that suddenly stick
- **Uneven floors** or tilting structures
- **Cracks in driveways** or patios near the suspected leak

## 6. Sound of Running Water

Sometimes you can hear underground leaks if you know what to listen for:

- **Hissing or whooshing** sounds near walls or floors
- **Running water sound** when no water is in use
- **Louder at night** when ambient noise is lower

Professional leak detectors use sensitive acoustic equipment to amplify these sounds and pinpoint leak locations.

## 7. Warm Spots on Floors

If you have hot water pipes running under concrete slabs, a leak can create:

- **Warm patches** on tile or concrete floors
- **Localised heating** in specific areas
- **Higher than normal** floor temperature

This is particularly noticeable in air-conditioned properties.

## Why Underground Leaks Are So Dangerous

Ignoring these warning signs can lead to:

- **Massive water bills**: A significant leak can waste thousands of litres per month
- **Foundation damage**: Water erosion undermines structural integrity
- **Mould and mildew**: Persistent dampness creates health hazards
- **Landscape destruction**: Erosion and root damage
- **Legal liability**: If the leak affects neighbouring properties

## Professional Underground Leak Detection

Finding the exact location of an underground leak requires specialist equipment:

### Technology We Use

- **Acoustic listening devices**: Amplify the sound of escaping water
- **Thermal imaging cameras**: Detect temperature differences caused by leaks
- **Tracer gas detection**: Inject harmless gas and detect where it surfaces

## The Spinning Meter Mystery

You've turned off every tap, made sure the washing machine isn't running, and checked that no toilets are flushing – but your water meter dial keeps moving. This frustrating situation is a clear indicator that water is escaping somewhere in your system.

Let's explore what this means and how to find the source.

## Confirming You Have a Leak

Before calling for help, perform this simple test:

### The 30-Minute Meter Test

1. **Locate your water meter** (usually in a box near the street or property boundary)
2. **Note the exact reading** including all decimal places
3. **Ensure no water is being used** anywhere on the property
4. **Wait 30 minutes** without using any water
5. **Check the reading again**

If the numbers have changed, you have a leak. The amount of change indicates the severity:

- **Small movement**: Minor leak, but still needs attention
- **Significant movement**: Major leak requiring urgent action
- **Fast spinning**: Serious leak – consider shutting off main supply

## Where Is the Water Going?

Hidden leaks can occur in several locations:

### Inside Your Property
- **Under floors**: Especially concrete slabs
- **Behind walls**: In concealed pipes
- **In ceilings**: If pipes run through upper floors
- **Toilet cisterns**: Silent overflow leaks

### Outside Your Property
- **Underground supply pipes**: Between meter and house
- **Garden irrigation**: Buried pipes and fittings
- **Swimming pool**: Plumbing and shell leaks
- **Water features**: Fountains and ponds

## Quick Checks You Can Do

Before calling professionals, try these simple investigations:

### Check All Toilets
1. Remove the cistern lid
2. Add food colouring to the tank
3. Wait 15 minutes without flushing
4. If colour appears in the bowl, the flapper valve is leaking

### Listen for Leaks
- Put your ear to walls near pipes
- Listen at night when it's quiet
- Check near water heaters and tanks

### Visual Inspection
- Look for damp patches on walls or floors
- Check under sinks and around appliances
- Inspect visible pipes for drips

## Why Hidden Leaks Are Costly

In Lanzarote, water is expensive. A leak that wastes just 1 litre per minute adds up to:

- **1,440 litres per day**
- **43,800 litres per month**
- **525,600 litres per year**

That's not just wasted water – it's wasted money and potential property damage.

## When to Call Professionals

If your meter test confirms a leak but you can't find the source, it's time for professional leak detection.

### What We Bring to the Search

At Canary Detect, we use:

- **Acoustic detection**: Listens for the sound of escaping water

## Why Are My Walls Damp?

Damp walls are a common problem in properties across Lanzarote, but the causes aren't always obvious. What looks like simple condensation could actually be a hidden water leak causing ongoing damage.

Understanding the type of dampness is the first step to solving the problem.

## Types of Wall Dampness

### 1. Rising Damp

Water from the ground rises up through walls by capillary action.

**Characteristics:**
- Affects ground floor walls only
- Tide marks up to 1 metre high
- Salt deposits on wall surface
- Peeling paint and wallpaper

**Common in Lanzarote**: Less common due to dry climate, but can occur in older properties without damp-proof course.

### 2. Penetrating Damp

Water enters through the wall from outside.

**Characteristics:**
- Can appear at any height
- Worse during or after rain
- Often localised to specific areas
- May follow cracks or damaged pointing

**Common in Lanzarote**: Very common, especially in properties exposed to weather or with aging exteriors.

### 3. Condensation

Warm, moist air meeting cold surfaces creates moisture.

**Characteristics:**
- Worse in winter months
- Often in corners and behind furniture
- Accompanied by mould growth
- Affects multiple rooms

**Common in Lanzarote**: Less common due to warm climate and good ventilation, but can occur in poorly ventilated properties.

### 4. Pipe Leaks

Hidden water pipes leaking behind walls.

**Characteristics:**
- Persistent dampness regardless of weather
- May be warm if hot water pipe
- Often localised to specific spots
- Can be accompanied by low water pressure

**Common in Lanzarote**: Very common, especially in older properties with aging pipework.

## How to Identify the Cause

### Visual Clues

| Sign | Likely Cause |
|------|--------------|
| Tide mark at consistent height | Rising damp |
| Damp after rainfall | Penetrating damp |
| Black mould growth | Condensation |
| Warm damp patch | Hot water pipe leak |
| Continuous dampness | Pipe leak |

### DIY Tests

**The Foil Test:**
1. Tape aluminium foil to the damp wall
2. Seal all edges with tape
3. Wait 24-48 hours
4. Check both sides of foil

- Moisture on wall side = internal source (pipe leak or rising damp)
- Moisture on room side = condensation

## The Dangers of Ignoring Damp Walls

Untreated dampness leads to:

- **Structural damage**: Weakened walls and plaster
- **Mould growth**: Health risks especially for respiratory conditions
- **Electrical hazards**: Water and electricity don't mix
- **Property devaluation**: Damp is a major concern for buyers
- **Increasing repair costs**: Problems worsen over time

## Professional Leak Detection for Damp Walls

When pipe leaks are suspected, professional detection is essential:

### Technology We Use

**Thermal Imaging**: Leaking pipes create temperature differences visible on thermal cameras. This non-invasive method shows us exactly where water is flowing behind your walls.

**Moisture Mapping**: Electronic moisture meters create a detailed map of dampness, helping identify the source and extent of water damage.

**Acoustic Detection**: Sensitive microphones can hear the sound of water escaping from pipes, even through walls and floors.

**Tracer Gas**: For difficult-to-find leaks, we inject harmless tracer gas into pipes and detect where it escapes.

## Solutions for Different Dampness Types

### For Pipe Leaks
1. Professional leak detection to locate source
2. Repair or replace damaged section
3. Allow walls to dry (may take weeks)
4. Replaster and redecorate

### For Penetrating Damp
1. Identify entry point
2. Repair external wall, pointing, or seals
3. Consider external waterproofing
4. Allow drying before redecorating

### For Rising Damp
1. Install chemical damp-proof course
2. Replaster with specialist render
3. Ensure ground levels are correct
4. Improve drainage around property

### For Condensation
1. Improve ventilation
2. Consider dehumidification
3. Increase insulation if possible
4. Address lifestyle factors

## The Science of Seeing the Invisible

Thermal imaging is one of the most powerful tools in modern leak detection. This technology allows us to "see" temperature differences that are invisible to the naked eye, revealing hidden water leaks without cutting into walls or floors.

## How Thermal Imaging Works

### The Basic Principle

Everything emits infrared radiation based on its temperature. Thermal imaging cameras detect this radiation and convert it into a visible image where different temperatures appear as different colours.

**In leak detection:**
- Water evaporating creates cooler areas
- Hot water pipes appear as warm lines
- Moisture in walls shows as temperature variations
- Leak locations become visible patterns

### What the Camera Sees

A typical thermal image shows:
- **Blue/purple**: Cooler areas (often wet)
- **Green/yellow**: Normal temperatures
- **Orange/red**: Warmer areas (hot pipes or sun-heated surfaces)

## Advantages of Thermal Imaging

### 1. Non-Invasive Detection

Traditional leak finding might involve:
- Cutting holes in walls
- Breaking up floors
- Excavating gardens

Thermal imaging requires **none of this**. We simply point the camera at surfaces and see what's happening inside.

### 2. Speed and Efficiency

A thermal survey can cover large areas quickly:
- Entire rooms in minutes
- Full properties in hours
- Immediate results on-screen

### 3. Documentation

Thermal images provide:
- Visual proof of leak locations
- Before and after comparison
- Evidence for insurance claims
- Records for contractors

### 4. Finding Multiple Issues

During a thermal survey, we often discover:
- Additional smaller leaks
- Insulation deficiencies
- Electrical hot spots
- Air infiltration points

## Limitations of Thermal Imaging

### It's Not X-Ray Vision

Thermal cameras see temperature differences on surfaces, not through them. We need:
- Temperature differences to exist
- Adequate time for heat transfer
- Suitable environmental conditions

### Best Conditions

Thermal imaging works best:
- When heating/cooling systems are running
- With temperature difference between inside and outside
- When surfaces have had time to stabilize
- Without direct sunlight interference

## Real-World Applications in Lanzarote

### Hot Water Pipe Leaks

Hot water pipes running through walls or under floors are easily detected:
- Hot water pipes show clearly as warm lines on the thermal image
- Leaks appear as wet cool spots where water is escaping
- Entire areas can be scanned quickly without disruption

### Swimming Pool Leaks

For pool leak detection:
- Thermal cameras can identify underground pipe routes
- Leaks show as cool spots where water surfaces
- Pool shells can be scanned for temperature anomalies

### Flat Roof Leaks

Many Lanzarote properties have flat roofs:
- Trapped moisture shows as temperature differences
- Entry points can be identified before rain
- Large areas surveyed efficiently

## Our Thermal Imaging Equipment

At Canary Detect, we use professional-grade thermal imaging cameras with:

- **High resolution**: Detailed images showing precise locations
- **Temperature accuracy**: ±2% readings for reliable analysis

## Cost-Saving Tips

### Act Early
Small leaks become big leaks. A fitting that's dripping today could be gushing next month. Early detection and repair saves money.

### Get Proper Detection First
Don't let contractors start digging without professional leak detection. Finding the exact location first prevents unnecessary excavation and repair costs.

### Consider Pool Age
For older pools with multiple issues, weigh repair costs against renovation options.

### Maintain Regularly
Preventive maintenance catches problems before they become expensive repairs.

## The True Cost of Ignoring Pool Leaks

A leaking pool costs money every day:

**Water loss**: Constant refilling increases water bills
**Chemical waste**: Water carries expensive chemicals away
**Energy costs**: Heating replacement water
**Structural damage**: Water undermines deck and surroundings
**Equipment wear**: Pumps work harder to maintain levels

Even a moderate leak can cost €50-100+ per month in water alone.

## Introducción

Para los residentes de Lanzarote, gestionar el agua es un aspecto fundamental de la vida diaria, profundamente arraigado en la historia e infraestructura de la isla. A diferencia de los sistemas alimentados directamente por la red que son comunes en muchas partes del mundo, los hogares de Lanzarote a menudo dependen de una combinación única de un tanque de agua subterráneo, conocido como **aljibe**, y un sistema de bombeo. Esta configuración es una respuesta directa al clima árido de la isla y a la escasez histórica de agua.

Sin embargo, este sistema tradicional presenta desafíos modernos, particularmente cuando se trata de detectar fugas de agua. En Canary Detect, encontramos que muchos escenarios desconcertantes de fugas tienen su origen en una incomprensión de cómo funcionan estos sistemas. Este artículo explica la historia detrás de la red de agua de Lanzarote, cómo funciona, y por qué hace que la detección de fugas sea un desafío único.

![Arquitectura Tradicional de Lanzarote](/assets/blog/lanzarote-traditional-house.jpg)

*La icónica arquitectura blanca de techos planos de Lanzarote, con el paisaje volcánico de fondo. Los aljibes domésticos modernos generalmente se llenan con camión cisterna en lugar de agua de lluvia.*

## Una Historia Forjada por la Escasez

![Aljibe Canario](/assets/blog/lanzarote-aljibe-cistern.jpg)

*Un aljibe canario tradicional en Lanzarote, mostrando el punto de acceso al tanque subterráneo rodeado de suelo volcánico.*

Lanzarote es la más seca de las Islas Canarias, recibiendo precipitaciones mínimas y sin ríos naturales ni aguas superficiales significativas. El término **aljibe** proviene del árabe *al-gúbb*, que significa cisterna o pozo, una tecnología introducida en la Península Ibérica hace siglos para almacenar el preciado agua en regiones áridas.

Históricamente, los isleños eran maestros en la conservación del agua, desarrollando métodos para capturar cada gota posible. Esto incluía grandes embalses públicos (*maretas*) y canales para recoger la escorrentía de agua de lluvia. Mientras que el diseño clásico de las casas canarias con techos planos era perfecto para canalizar el agua de lluvia hacia un aljibe doméstico, el método principal para llenar estos tanques domésticos durante muchos años ha sido la entrega con camión cisterna, conocido localmente como *pipa*.

Incluso con la llegada de las modernas plantas desalinizadoras en la década de 1960, que ahora abastecen a toda la isla, el legado de la escasez de agua persiste. El suministro de agua de la red puede ser inconsistente, con baja presión y, en algunas zonas rurales, cortes programados que pueden dejar a los hogares sin agua durante días. Como resultado, el sistema de aljibe y bomba sigue siendo un componente esencial de la mayoría de los hogares, proporcionando un amortiguador crucial y asegurando una presión de agua constante.

![Camión Cisterna](/assets/blog/lanzarote-water-tanker.jpg)

*Los camiones cisterna (pipas) siguen siendo una vista común en las Islas Canarias, entregando agua para llenar los aljibes domésticos, especialmente durante las interrupciones del suministro.*

## Cómo Funciona el Sistema de Aljibe y Bomba

Un sistema típico de agua doméstica en Lanzarote consta de tres partes principales:

1. **El Aljibe:** Un tanque de almacenamiento subterráneo, típicamente hecho de hormigón, que contiene la reserva principal de agua del hogar. Se llena desde el suministro de la red a través de una tubería controlada por una válvula de flotador.
2. **La Válvula de Flotador (Boya):** Esta válvula se abre automáticamente para rellenar el aljibe desde la red cuando el nivel del agua baja y se cierra cuando está lleno. Funciona igual que el mecanismo dentro de una cisterna del váter.
3. **El Grupo de Presión:** Debido a que la presión de la red a menudo es demasiado baja para las necesidades del hogar, se utiliza una bomba para extraer agua del aljibe y entregarla a los grifos, duchas y electrodomésticos a una presión constante y utilizable.

Muchos hogares también cuentan con un **bypass de la red**. Esta es una derivación del suministro de la red (después de la alimentación de la boya al aljibe) que conecta directamente a la tubería de la casa después de la bomba, controlada por una válvula. En la práctica, este bypass a menudo se deja abierto, con la bomba funcionando normalmente. La red proporciona un nivel base de presión, y la bomba "completa" la presión para asegurar un flujo adecuado en toda la casa. Si la bomba falla, la casa sigue recibiendo agua directamente de la red (aunque a menor presión). Esta disposición de doble alimentación es práctica pero añade complejidad al diagnosticar fugas.

![Diagrama del Sistema de la Casa](/assets/blog/lanzarote-water-system-house.png)

*Un sistema típico de agua doméstica de Lanzarote en contexto: el agua de la red entra a través del contador, alimenta el aljibe subterráneo a través de una válvula de flotador, y el grupo de presión (sobre el suelo) extrae el agua para abastecer la casa. La válvula de bypass permite que el agua de la red complemente el suministro de la bomba.*

![Diagrama Esquemático](/assets/blog/lanzarote-water-system-diagram.png)

*Vista esquemática: el agua de la red alimenta el aljibe a través de una válvula de flotador, mientras que una rama de bypass (a menudo dejada abierta) proporciona presión directa de la red. La bomba extrae del aljibe para aumentar la presión, y ambos suministros se combinan antes de llegar a la casa.*

## El Desafío Único de la Detección de Fugas

Este sistema crea desafíos específicos al intentar identificar una fuga de agua, a menudo llevando a señales confusas del contador de agua.

### Misterio 1: El Contador de Agua Intermitente

Una suposición común es que una fuga hará que el contador de agua gire continuamente. Con un sistema de aljibe, esto rara vez es el caso. Si tienes una fuga dentro de tu casa (por ejemplo, un grifo goteando o un váter defectuoso), el agua se está perdiendo del **lado alimentado por la bomba** del sistema. El agua viene del aljibe, no directamente de la red.

Tu contador de agua solo girará durante breves períodos cuando la válvula de flotador en el aljibe se abra para reponer el agua que se ha perdido. Esto significa que una fuga significativa puede pasar desapercibida, ya que el contador parece estar estático la mayor parte del tiempo, solo para girar intermitentemente mientras el tanque se rellena solo.

### Misterio 2: El Contador que Gira Constantemente (Que No Es una Fuga)

Por el contrario, un contador que gira constantemente no siempre significa que tienes una fuga en las tuberías de tu propiedad. El culpable más común en este escenario es una **válvula de flotador defectuosa** en el propio aljibe.

Si la válvula no se cierra correctamente cuando el tanque está lleno, el agua de la red goteará continuamente y se desbordará del aljibe. Sin embargo, es poco probable que veas agua acumulándose en la superficie. La mayoría de los aljibes no son completamente herméticos hasta arriba. La sección superior, típicamente por encima del nivel del 80-90% lleno o por encima de donde se asienta la boya, a menudo no está sellada. Cuando el agua sube más allá de este punto, simplemente se filtra en el suelo circundante y desaparece bajo las baldosas de tu patio, completamente desapercibida. Para un observador, el contador gira sin parar, creando la ilusión perfecta de una fuga importante. En realidad, es una simple falla mecánica en el mecanismo de llenado del tanque.

![Detección de Fugas del Contador de Agua](/assets/blog/lanzarote-water-meter-leak.png)

*Un indicador de fugas girando en un contador de agua puede ser causado por una fuga real o una válvula de flotador defectuosa en el aljibe.*

### La Bomba Delatora

Una de las señales más claras de una fuga en un sistema de aljibe es el comportamiento de la bomba misma. Si nadie está usando agua, la bomba debería permanecer en silencio. Una fuga en el lado alimentado por la bomba drenará lentamente la presión en el sistema, haciendo que la bomba se active periódicamente para restaurarla.

### El Factor de la Válvula de Retención

Un componente crítico pero a menudo pasado por alto en estos sistemas es la **válvula de retención** (también llamada válvula antirretorno). Estas se instalan típicamente en el contador de agua y en la tubería de bypass de la red. Su trabajo es evitar que el agua fluya hacia atrás hacia el suministro de la red.

Cuando una válvula de retención falla, la mayor presión de la bomba puede empujar el agua de vuelta hacia la red. Esto hace que la bomba funcione frecuentemente mientras intenta mantener la presión contra un sistema que efectivamente está "perdiendo" agua por donde vino. Los síntomas imitan una fuga genuina: la bomba se enciende y apaga, y el contador de agua gira.

Podrías asumir que el agua fluyendo hacia atrás haría que el contador girara en reversa, reduciendo tu factura. En la práctica, generalmente ocurre lo contrario. Los contadores de agua están diseñados para medir el flujo hacia adelante, y cuando el agua oscila hacia adelante y hacia atrás debido a fluctuaciones de presión, el contador tiende a registrar más movimiento hacia adelante que hacia atrás. El resultado es una factura de agua más alta, no más baja.

### La Complicación del Bypass

Si tu propiedad tiene un bypass de la red, añade otra capa de complejidad. Podría existir una fuga en el lado alimentado por la red o en el lado alimentado por la bomba, y aislar la fuente requiere cerrar sistemáticamente diferentes partes del sistema para observar el comportamiento del contador. Este puede ser un proceso desafiante para el propietario promedio.

## Conclusión: Conoce Tu Sistema

Entender si tu agua viene directamente de la red o a través de un aljibe y bomba es el primer y más crítico paso para diagnosticar una posible fuga en Lanzarote. El comportamiento de tu contador de agua puede ser engañoso si no sabes a qué está conectado.

Si sospechas una fuga pero no puedes entender lo que tu contador de agua te está diciendo, las características únicas de tu sistema de agua son probablemente la razón. Antes de enfrentarte a una factura de agua alta o posibles daños a la propiedad, es esencial obtener un diagnóstico experto.

## ¿Se Puede Beber el Agua?

Esta es una de las preguntas más frecuentes de visitantes y nuevos residentes, y la respuesta no es un simple "sí" o "no". Requiere entender la diferencia entre el agua que entra en tu propiedad y el agua que sale de tu grifo.

### La Posición Oficial: Sí, Es Potable

Legal y técnicamente, el agua suministrada por Canal Gestión Lanzarote es segura para beber. Es agua de mar desalinizada que pasa por ósmosis inversa, remineralización (añadiendo calcio y magnesio) y cloración. Debe cumplir con estrictos criterios sanitarios establecidos por la **Directiva UE 2020/2184** sobre la calidad del agua destinada al consumo humano.

Se realizan pruebas regulares para asegurar que cumple con estos estándares en el punto de suministro. Expertos de la Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria e inspectores de salud locales han confirmado que el agua de la red es segura, a menudo conteniendo menos residuos plásticos que el agua embotellada.

### La Realidad: Depende de Tu Tanque

Mientras que el agua es segura cuando pasa por el contador, la seguridad de lo que sale de tu grifo depende enteramente de dónde ha sido almacenada.

En nuestros años en Canary Detect, hemos inspeccionado el interior de innumerables aljibes. La realidad es cruda:

- **Lo Bueno:** Algunos tanques están impecables, bien mantenidos y perfectamente seguros.
- **Lo Malo:** Otros son sitios de "puro horror" que te harían correr al baño solo con mirarlos. Hemos visto tanques con acumulación de sedimentos, intrusión de raíces, hormigón desmoronándose, e incluso plagas ahogadas.

Si el agua de tu grifo viene de un aljibe que no ha sido limpiado o inspeccionado en años, puede que ya no sea segura para beber, independientemente de su calidad en el contador.

### Nuestra Recomendación

Si quieres beber agua del grifo (que es más barata, ecológica y conveniente), sigue estas reglas:

1. **Evita el Tanque para Beber:** La opción más segura es tener un grifo dedicado para "agua potable" en tu cocina que esté conectado **directamente a la red**, evitando completamente el aljibe y la bomba. Esto asegura que estás bebiendo el agua regulada y segura directamente de la red de suministro.
2. **Mantén Tu Aljibe:** Si debes usar agua del tanque, trata tu aljibe como la infraestructura crítica que es. Requiere inspección regular, limpieza e impermeabilización para prevenir la contaminación.
3. **Comprueba el Estado:** No asumas que tu tanque está limpio. Haz que lo inspeccionen. Si está en malas condiciones, úsalo solo para lavar y tirar de la cadena hasta que pueda ser remediado profesionalmente.

## ¿Tu Piscina Está Perdiendo Agua?

Si has notado que el nivel del agua de tu piscina baja más rápido de lo normal, no estás solo. Muchos propietarios de piscinas en Lanzarote enfrentan este problema, especialmente durante los meses calurosos de verano. Pero, ¿cómo saber si es evaporación o una fuga real?

En esta guía completa, te mostraremos **cómo detectar fugas en piscinas** usando métodos caseros sencillos, y te explicaremos cuándo es momento de llamar a servicios profesionales de detección de fugas.

## Entendiendo la Pérdida de Agua en Piscinas

Antes de alarmarte por una posible fuga, es importante entender que cierta pérdida de agua es normal:

- **Evaporación**: En el clima cálido de Lanzarote, las piscinas pueden perder 3-7mm de agua al día por evaporación
- **Salpicaduras**: La natación activa y los juegos pueden causar pérdida significativa de agua
- **Lavado del filtro**: La limpieza del filtro elimina agua de tu piscina
- **Viento**: Los vientos alisios de Lanzarote aceleran la evaporación

Si pierdes más de 5cm de agua por semana, probablemente tengas una fuga que necesita atención.

## La Prueba del Cubo: Tu Primer Paso

La prueba del cubo es el método casero más fiable para determinar si tu piscina tiene una fuga o simplemente está evaporando agua. Mira este excelente vídeo de Swim University que demuestra exactamente cómo realizar la prueba:

<div class="video-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqiz4qBJU_g&t=37s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="video-link group"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Zqiz4qBJU_g/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Vídeo Prueba del Cubo - Cómo Encontrar una Fuga en la Piscina" class="video-thumb-img" /><span class="play-button">▶</span><span class="video-caption">🎬 Ver: Prueba del Cubo - Cómo Encontrar una Fuga (YouTube)</span></a></div>

### Prueba del Cubo Paso a Paso

1. **Lleva el agua de tu piscina al nivel normal** antes de comenzar la prueba
2. **Llena un cubo de 20 litros** con agua de la piscina hasta aproximadamente 2,5cm del borde
3. **Coloca el cubo en el primer o segundo escalón** para que la temperatura del agua coincida
4. **Marca el nivel del agua** dentro del cubo con cinta o rotulador
5. **Marca el nivel del agua de la piscina** en el exterior del cubo
6. **Espera 24 horas** sin usar la piscina ni encender ningún equipo
7. **Compara los niveles** - si el nivel de la piscina bajó más que el del cubo, tienes una fuga

### Interpretando Tus Resultados

- **Bajada igual**: Evaporación normal - no se detecta fuga
- **La piscina bajó más**: Tienes una fuga - hora de detección profesional
- **La piscina bajó significativamente más**: Fuga seria que requiere atención inmediata

## La Prueba del Tinte: Localizando Fugas Visibles

Si sospechas una fuga cerca de accesorios, luces o grietas visibles, la prueba del tinte puede ayudar a confirmar:

1. Apaga todo el equipo de la piscina
2. Deja que el agua quede completamente quieta
3. Usa colorante alimentario o tinte de detección de fugas
4. Aplica el tinte cerca de las áreas sospechosas
5. Observa si el tinte es atraído hacia grietas o huecos

**Consejo profesional**: Esta prueba funciona mejor en días calmados sin viento.

## Ubicaciones Comunes de Fugas en Piscinas

Basándonos en nuestra experiencia detectando fugas de piscinas en toda Lanzarote, estas son las ubicaciones más comunes:

## Fugas de Agua Ocultas: El Destructor Silencioso de Propiedades

Las fugas de agua subterráneas están entre los problemas más dañinos que un propietario puede enfrentar. A diferencia de las fugas visibles, pueden pasar desapercibidas durante meses o incluso años, causando lentamente daños estructurales y desperdiciando miles de euros en agua.

En Lanzarote, donde el agua es preciosa y cara, detectar fugas subterráneas temprano es crucial. Aquí están las **7 señales de advertencia** que todo propietario debe conocer.

## 1. Facturas de Agua Inexplicablemente Altas

La primera señal más común de una fuga subterránea es un aumento repentino en tu factura de agua sin un aumento correspondiente en el uso.

**Qué buscar:**
- Factura 20% o más alta de lo habitual
- Aumento constante durante varios meses
- Sin cambio en los hábitos de consumo de agua del hogar

**Consejo profesional**: Compara tu factura actual con el mismo período del año pasado, ya que las variaciones estacionales pueden afectar el consumo.

## 2. Contador de Agua Girando Cuando Todos los Grifos Están Cerrados

Esta es una de las pruebas más definitivas para una fuga de agua oculta:

### Cómo Revisar tu Contador de Agua

1. Cierra todos los electrodomésticos que usan agua
2. Asegúrate de que no hay grifos abiertos
3. Localiza tu contador de agua
4. Anota la lectura o mira el dial
5. Espera 30 minutos sin usar agua
6. Revisa el contador de nuevo

Si el contador se ha movido, tienes una fuga en algún lugar de tu sistema.

## 3. Zonas Húmedas o Encharcadas en tu Jardín

Las fugas de agua subterráneas a menudo emergen como áreas húmedas inexplicables:

- **Zonas inusualmente verdes** en césped que por lo demás está seco
- **Puntos fangosos o blandos** que nunca se secan
- **Agua acumulándose** en la superficie sin fuente obvia
- **Canales de erosión** apareciendo en el paisajismo

En el clima seco de Lanzarote, las manchas húmedas persistentes son particularmente sospechosas.

## 4. Baja Presión de Agua en Toda la Casa

Una fuga en tu línea de suministro principal puede causar caídas de presión notables:

- **Disminución gradual** de la presión durante semanas o meses
- **Afecta a todos los grifos** por igual (a diferencia de un problema específico de un accesorio)
- **Peor durante** horas pico de uso

## 5. Grietas en Paredes, Suelos o Cimientos

El agua socava los cimientos y causa movimiento estructural:

- **Nuevas grietas** apareciendo en paredes o techos
- **Puertas y ventanas** que de repente se atascan
- **Suelos desnivelados** o estructuras inclinadas
- **Grietas en entradas** o patios cerca de la sospechada fuga

## 6. Sonido de Agua Corriendo

A veces puedes escuchar fugas subterráneas si sabes qué buscar:

- **Silbidos o zumbidos** cerca de paredes o suelos
- **Sonido de agua corriendo** cuando no se usa agua
- **Más fuerte por la noche** cuando el ruido ambiental es menor

Los detectores profesionales de fugas usan equipos acústicos sensibles para amplificar estos sonidos y localizar con precisión las ubicaciones de las fugas.

## 7. Zonas Calientes en los Suelos

Si tienes tuberías de agua caliente bajo losas de hormigón, una fuga puede crear:

- **Zonas calientes** en suelos de baldosas o hormigón
- **Calentamiento localizado** en áreas específicas
- **Temperatura del suelo más alta** de lo normal

Esto es particularmente notable en propiedades con aire acondicionado.

## Por Qué las Fugas Subterráneas Son Tan Peligrosas

Ignorar estas señales de advertencia puede llevar a:

- **Facturas de agua enormes**: Una fuga significativa puede desperdiciar miles de litros al mes
- **Daños en cimientos**: La erosión del agua socava la integridad estructural
- **Moho y hongos**: La humedad persistente crea riesgos para la salud
- **Destrucción del paisaje**: Erosión y daño a las raíces
- **Responsabilidad legal**: Si la fuga afecta propiedades vecinas

## Detección Profesional de Fugas Subterráneas

Encontrar la ubicación exacta de una fuga subterránea requiere equipo especializado:

### Tecnología que Usamos

- **Dispositivos de escucha acústica**: Amplifican el sonido del agua escapando
- **Cámaras de imagen térmica**: Detectan diferencias de temperatura causadas por fugas

## El Misterio del Contador que Gira

Has cerrado todos los grifos, te has asegurado de que la lavadora no está funcionando, y has comprobado que ningún inodoro está descargando – pero el dial de tu contador de agua sigue moviéndose. Esta situación frustrante es un indicador claro de que el agua está escapando de algún lugar de tu sistema.

Vamos a explorar qué significa esto y cómo encontrar la fuente.

## Confirmando que Tienes una Fuga

Antes de llamar para pedir ayuda, realiza esta simple prueba:

### La Prueba del Contador de 30 Minutos

1. **Localiza tu contador de agua** (normalmente en una caja cerca de la calle o el límite de la propiedad)
2. **Anota la lectura exacta** incluyendo todos los decimales
3. **Asegúrate de que no se usa agua** en ningún lugar de la propiedad
4. **Espera 30 minutos** sin usar agua
5. **Revisa la lectura de nuevo**

Si los números han cambiado, tienes una fuga. La cantidad de cambio indica la gravedad:

- **Movimiento pequeño**: Fuga menor, pero aún necesita atención
- **Movimiento significativo**: Fuga mayor que requiere acción urgente
- **Giro rápido**: Fuga seria – considera cerrar el suministro principal

## ¿A Dónde Va el Agua?

Las fugas ocultas pueden ocurrir en varias ubicaciones:

### Dentro de tu Propiedad
- **Bajo los suelos**: Especialmente losas de hormigón
- **Detrás de las paredes**: En tuberías ocultas
- **En los techos**: Si las tuberías pasan por pisos superiores
- **Cisternas de inodoros**: Fugas de rebosamiento silenciosas

### Fuera de tu Propiedad
- **Tuberías de suministro subterráneas**: Entre el contador y la casa
- **Riego del jardín**: Tuberías enterradas y accesorios
- **Piscina**: Fugas de fontanería y del vaso
- **Fuentes ornamentales**: Fuentes y estanques

## Comprobaciones Rápidas que Puedes Hacer

Antes de llamar a profesionales, prueba estas investigaciones sencillas:

### Revisa Todos los Inodoros
1. Quita la tapa de la cisterna
2. Añade colorante alimentario al tanque
3. Espera 15 minutos sin tirar de la cadena
4. Si aparece color en la taza, la válvula de descarga está fugando

### Escucha las Fugas
- Pon tu oído en las paredes cerca de las tuberías
- Escucha por la noche cuando está tranquilo
- Revisa cerca de calentadores de agua y tanques

### Inspección Visual
- Busca manchas húmedas en paredes o suelos
- Revisa bajo los fregaderos y alrededor de electrodomésticos
- Inspecciona tuberías visibles en busca de goteos

## Por Qué las Fugas Ocultas Son Costosas

En Lanzarote, el agua es cara. Una fuga que desperdicia solo 1 litro por minuto suma:

- **1.440 litros al día**
- **43.800 litros al mes**
- **525.600 litros al año**

Eso no es solo agua desperdiciada – es dinero desperdiciado y potencial daño a la propiedad.

## Cuándo Llamar a Profesionales

Si tu prueba del contador confirma una fuga pero no puedes encontrar la fuente, es hora de detección profesional de fugas.

### Lo Que Aportamos a la Búsqueda

En Canary Detect, usamos:

- **Detección acústica**: Escucha el sonido del agua escapando
- **Imagen térmica**: Ve los cambios de temperatura de las fugas
- **Gas trazador**: Encuentra el punto exacto de salida de las fugas

## ¿Por Qué Están Mis Paredes Húmedas?

Las paredes húmedas son un problema común en propiedades de toda Lanzarote, pero las causas no siempre son obvias. Lo que parece simple condensación podría ser en realidad una fuga de agua oculta causando daño continuo.

Entender el tipo de humedad es el primer paso para resolver el problema.

## Tipos de Humedad en Paredes

### 1. Humedad por Capilaridad

El agua del suelo sube a través de las paredes por acción capilar.

**Características:**
- Afecta solo a paredes de planta baja
- Marcas de marea hasta 1 metro de altura
- Depósitos de sal en la superficie de la pared
- Pintura y papel tapiz despegándose

**Común en Lanzarote**: Menos común debido al clima seco, pero puede ocurrir en propiedades antiguas sin barrera antihumedad.

### 2. Humedad por Filtración

El agua entra a través de la pared desde el exterior.

**Características:**
- Puede aparecer a cualquier altura
- Peor durante o después de la lluvia
- A menudo localizada en áreas específicas
- Puede seguir grietas o juntas dañadas

**Común en Lanzarote**: Muy común, especialmente en propiedades expuestas al clima o con exteriores envejecidos.

### 3. Condensación

El aire cálido y húmedo encontrándose con superficies frías crea humedad.

**Características:**
- Peor en meses de invierno
- A menudo en esquinas y detrás de muebles
- Acompañada de crecimiento de moho
- Afecta múltiples habitaciones

**Común en Lanzarote**: Menos común debido al clima cálido y buena ventilación, pero puede ocurrir en propiedades mal ventiladas.

### 4. Fugas de Tuberías

Tuberías de agua ocultas fugando detrás de las paredes.

**Características:**
- Humedad persistente independientemente del clima
- Puede estar caliente si es tubería de agua caliente
- A menudo localizada en puntos específicos
- Puede estar acompañada de baja presión de agua

**Común en Lanzarote**: Muy común, especialmente en propiedades antiguas con tuberías envejecidas.

## Cómo Identificar la Causa

### Pistas Visuales

| Señal | Causa Probable |
|-------|----------------|
| Marca de marea a altura constante | Humedad por capilaridad |
| Húmedo después de la lluvia | Humedad por filtración |
| Crecimiento de moho negro | Condensación |
| Mancha húmeda caliente | Fuga de tubería de agua caliente |
| Humedad continua | Fuga de tubería |

### Pruebas Caseras

**La Prueba del Papel de Aluminio:**
1. Pega papel de aluminio a la pared húmeda
2. Sella todos los bordes con cinta
3. Espera 24-48 horas
4. Revisa ambos lados del papel

- Humedad en el lado de la pared = fuente interna (fuga de tubería o capilaridad)
- Humedad en el lado de la habitación = condensación

## Los Peligros de Ignorar Paredes Húmedas

La humedad no tratada lleva a:

- **Daño estructural**: Paredes y yeso debilitados
- **Crecimiento de moho**: Riesgos para la salud especialmente para condiciones respiratorias
- **Peligros eléctricos**: El agua y la electricidad no se mezclan
- **Devaluación de la propiedad**: La humedad es una preocupación importante para compradores
- **Costos de reparación crecientes**: Los problemas empeoran con el tiempo

## Detección Profesional de Fugas para Paredes Húmedas

Cuando se sospechan fugas de tuberías, la detección profesional es esencial:

### Tecnología que Usamos

**Imagen Térmica**: Las tuberías con fugas crean diferencias de temperatura visibles en cámaras térmicas. Este método no invasivo nos muestra exactamente dónde fluye el agua detrás de tus paredes.

**Mapeo de Humedad**: Los medidores electrónicos de humedad crean un mapa detallado de la humedad, ayudando a identificar la fuente y extensión del daño por agua.

**Detección Acústica**: Micrófonos sensibles pueden escuchar el sonido del agua escapando de las tuberías, incluso a través de paredes y suelos.

**Gas Trazador**: Para fugas difíciles de encontrar, inyectamos gas trazador inofensivo en las tuberías y detectamos dónde escapa.

## Soluciones para Diferentes Tipos de Humedad

### Para Fugas de Tuberías
1. Detección profesional de fugas para localizar la fuente
2. Reparar o reemplazar la sección dañada
3. Permitir que las paredes se sequen (puede tomar semanas)
4. Reenyesar y redecorar

### Para Humedad por Filtración
1. Identificar punto de entrada
2. Reparar pared exterior, juntas o sellados
3. Considerar impermeabilización externa
4. Permitir secado antes de redecorar

### Para Humedad por Capilaridad
1. Instalar barrera química antihumedad
2. Reenyesar con mortero especializado
3. Asegurar que los niveles del suelo son correctos
4. Mejorar el drenaje alrededor de la propiedad

### Para Condensación
1. Mejorar la ventilación
2. Considerar deshumidificación
3. Aumentar el aislamiento si es posible
4. Abordar factores de estilo de vida

## La Ciencia de Ver lo Invisible

La imagen térmica es una de las herramientas más potentes en la detección moderna de fugas. Esta tecnología nos permite "ver" diferencias de temperatura que son invisibles a simple vista, revelando fugas de agua ocultas sin cortar paredes o suelos.

## Cómo Funciona la Imagen Térmica

### El Principio Básico

Todo emite radiación infrarroja basada en su temperatura. Las cámaras de imagen térmica detectan esta radiación y la convierten en una imagen visible donde diferentes temperaturas aparecen como diferentes colores.

**En detección de fugas:**
- El agua evaporándose crea áreas más frías
- Las tuberías de agua caliente aparecen como líneas cálidas
- La humedad en las paredes se muestra como variaciones de temperatura
- Las ubicaciones de fugas se convierten en patrones visibles

### Lo Que Ve la Cámara

Una imagen térmica típica muestra:
- **Azul/púrpura**: Áreas más frías (a menudo húmedas)
- **Verde/amarillo**: Temperaturas normales
- **Naranja/rojo**: Áreas más cálidas (tuberías calientes o superficies calentadas por el sol)

## Ventajas de la Imagen Térmica

### 1. Detección No Invasiva

La búsqueda tradicional de fugas podría implicar:
- Hacer agujeros en paredes
- Romper suelos
- Excavar jardines

La imagen térmica no requiere **nada de esto**. Simplemente apuntamos la cámara a las superficies y vemos lo que está pasando dentro.

### 2. Velocidad y Eficiencia

Una inspección térmica puede cubrir grandes áreas rápidamente:
- Habitaciones enteras en minutos
- Propiedades completas en horas
- Resultados inmediatos en pantalla

### 3. Documentación

Las imágenes térmicas proporcionan:
- Prueba visual de ubicaciones de fugas
- Comparación antes y después
- Evidencia para reclamaciones de seguros
- Registros para contratistas

### 4. Encontrar Múltiples Problemas

Durante una inspección térmica, a menudo descubrimos:
- Fugas adicionales más pequeñas
- Deficiencias de aislamiento
- Puntos calientes eléctricos
- Puntos de infiltración de aire

## Limitaciones de la Imagen Térmica

### No Es Visión de Rayos X

Las cámaras térmicas ven diferencias de temperatura en superficies, no a través de ellas. Necesitamos:
- Que existan diferencias de temperatura
- Tiempo adecuado para transferencia de calor
- Condiciones ambientales apropiadas

### Mejores Condiciones

La imagen térmica funciona mejor:
- Cuando los sistemas de calefacción/refrigeración están funcionando
- Con diferencia de temperatura entre interior y exterior
- Cuando las superficies han tenido tiempo de estabilizarse
- Sin interferencia de luz solar directa

## Aplicaciones del Mundo Real en Lanzarote

### Fugas de Tuberías de Agua Caliente

Las tuberías de agua caliente que pasan por paredes o bajo suelos se detectan fácilmente:
- Las tuberías de agua caliente se muestran claramente como líneas cálidas en la imagen térmica
- Las fugas aparecen como manchas frías húmedas donde el agua está escapando
- Áreas enteras pueden escanearse rápidamente sin molestias

### Fugas de Piscinas

Para detección de fugas de piscinas:
- Las cámaras térmicas pueden identificar rutas de tuberías subterráneas
- Las fugas se muestran como puntos fríos donde el agua emerge
- Los vasos de piscinas pueden escanearse en busca de anomalías de temperatura

### Fugas de Techos Planos

Muchas propiedades de Lanzarote tienen techos planos:

## Entendiendo los Costes de Fugas de Piscina

Cuando tu piscina está perdiendo agua, una de tus primeras preguntas probablemente sea "¿Cuánto costará arreglar esto?" La respuesta depende de varios factores, desde el tipo de fuga hasta su ubicación y accesibilidad.

## Consejos para Ahorrar Costes

### Actúa Temprano
Las fugas pequeñas se convierten en fugas grandes. Un accesorio que gotea hoy podría estar soltando chorros el próximo mes. La detección y reparación temprana ahorra dinero.

### Obtén Detección Adecuada Primero
No dejes que los contratistas empiecen a cavar sin detección profesional de fugas. Encontrar la ubicación exacta primero previene excavación innecesaria y costes de reparación.

### Considera la Edad de la Piscina
Para piscinas antiguas con múltiples problemas, sopesa los costes de reparación contra opciones de renovación.

### Mantenimiento Regular
El mantenimiento preventivo detecta problemas antes de que se conviertan en reparaciones caras.

## El Verdadero Coste de Ignorar Fugas de Piscina

Una piscina con fugas cuesta dinero cada día:

**Pérdida de agua**: Rellenado constante aumenta las facturas de agua
**Desperdicio de químicos**: El agua arrastra químicos caros
**Costes de energía**: Calentar agua de reposición
**Daño estructural**: El agua socava la terraza y alrededores
**Desgaste de equipos**: Las bombas trabajan más duro para mantener niveles

Incluso una fuga moderada puede costar 50-100€+ al mes solo en agua.

## Paso 1: Precisión Milimétrica

### Tecnología Avanzada Localiza la Fuente

Usando equipos de **detección acústica y gas trazador** de última generación, localizamos la ubicación exacta de la fuga. Esta precisión elimina las conjeturas y el daño innecesario a tu propiedad.

### Services Grid (6 Service Cards)

#### 1. Valve Replacements
**Icon:** Valve/Settings icon

**Content:**
Pool valves endure constant use and exposure to chlorinated water, leading to corrosion, seizure, and eventual failure. We replace worn multiport valves, ball valves, check valves, and isolation valves with high-quality replacements designed for pool environments.

**Services include:**

- Ball valve and gate valve replacements
- Check valve installations
- Isolation valve additions for easier maintenance

#### 2. Pipe Repairs & Renewals
**Icon:** Pipette/Pipe icon

**Content:**
Lanzarote's conditions can be tough on pool pipework. Sun exposure degrades above-ground pipes, while underground sections can suffer from ground movement and root intrusion. We repair, renew, and upgrade pool pipework using durable PVC pressure pipe rated for pool systems.
